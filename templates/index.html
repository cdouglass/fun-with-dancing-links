<h1>Fun with dancing links</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This project is a demonstration of the use of the dancing links method of solving exact cover problems. So far only the N queens portion of the project is complete; next I plan to use the same solver to produce playable Sudoku puzzles, randomly generating clue sets and filtering out those that do not have exactly one solution.</p>

<h3>Context: Exact cover problems</h3>

<p>These are problems where the goal is to find a solution satisfying each one of a set of conditions exactly once. Sudoku is an example that's easy to visualize: each row, column, and sub-grid must contain exactly one of each digit from 1 through 9. Solving problems of this form, as far as we know, has a time requirement that's exponential in the size of the input.</p>

<p>The obvious way to find all solutions to such a problem is performing a depth-first search using backtracking; the dancing links technique uses a nifty data structure that makes backtracking more efficient. A paper describing its use, with several examples, is available at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047">arxiv.org</a>.</p>

<h3>The N queens problem</h3>

<p>This is a generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">eight queens problem</a>, a well-known chess puzzle where the goal is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chess board so that none of them threaten one another.</p>

<p>The N queens problem is not strictly an exact cover problem, since each diagonal may contain either one or zero queens. Currently I'm fudging this by adding dummy piece placements that each cover one diagonal and no ranks or files, but there's a faster way to handle this that I'll implement at some point.</p>
