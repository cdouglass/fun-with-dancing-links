<h1>Fun with dancing links</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This project is a demonstration of the use of the dancing links method of solving exact cover problems. So far only the N queens portion of the project is complete; next I plan to use the same solver to produce playable Sudoku puzzles, randomly generating clue sets and filtering out those that do not have exactly one solution.</p>

<h3>Context: Exact cover problems</h3>

<p>These are problems where the goal is to find a solution satisfying each one of a set of conditions exactly once. Sudoku is an example that's easy to visualize: each row, column, and sub-grid must contain exactly one of each digit from 1 through 9. Solving problems of this form, as far as we know, has a time requirement that's exponential in the size of the input.</p>

<p>The obvious way to find all solutions to such a problem is performing a depth-first search using backtracking; the dancing links technique uses a nifty data structure that makes backtracking more efficient. A paper describing its use, with several examples, is available at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047">arxiv.org</a>.</p>

<h3>The N queens problem</h3>

<p>This is a generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">eight queens problem</a>, a well-known chess puzzle where the goal is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chess board so that none of them threaten one another.</p>

<p>The N queens problem is not strictly an exact cover problem, since each diagonal may contain either one or zero queens. This can be handled with a slight change to the data structure involved so that the program will not waste time trying to cover diagonals.</p>

<h3>Sudoku</h3>

<p>This is a straightforward exact cover problem: each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must have exactly one of each digit from 1 through 9. Here we randomly generate a set of clues, using the exact cover solver to confirm that the clue set yields exactly one solution before presenting it to the user.</p>
